#Program #1 prints "Hello World" 100 times
#Program #2 writes this list of numbers, each on a new line, followed by the list of numbers and its square on a new line
#Program #3 asks the user for the number of sides, the length of the side, the color of the line, and the fill color of a regular polygon.
#The program draws the polygon and then fills it in.
#Program #4 interates integers from 1 to 50.
#For multiples of three, it prints “Divisible by three” instead of the number.
#For the multiples of five it prints “Divisible by five” instead of the number.
#For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints “Divisible by both”. 
#Program #5 draws a little turtle flower.
